**Get Tired Less and Learn More with Scientific RSVP Method!**

ClipReader is an innovative Android application that implements the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) reading method, developed with unique approach based on scientific research for 100% efficiency.

## 📱 Download

**Get latest version of ClipReader from [RuStore](https://www.rustore.ru/catalog/app/com.clipreader)**

## 🚀 Features

- **RSVP Reading Technology**: Advanced word-by-word reading presentation
- **Scientific Foundation**: Built on proven research methodologies for optimal reading efficiency  
- **Eye Strain Reduction**: Minimizes visual fatigue during extended reading sessions
- **Speed Enhancement**: Significantly increases reading speed while maintaining comprehension
- **Android Optimized**: Native performance tailored for mobile reading experience

## 🧠 What is RSVP?

Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a scientifically-proven method that presents text one word at a time in a fixed location on the screen. This technique:

- **Eliminates eye movement** across the page
- **Reduces cognitive load** by focusing attention on individual words
- **Forces the brain to focus** on reading without distractions from surrounding elements
- **Increases reading speed** without sacrificing comprehension
- **Minimizes visual fatigue** compared to traditional reading methods

## 🔬 Scientific Approach

Unlike other reading applications, ClipReader is built on a solid scientific foundation that allows the RSVP reading method to reach its full 100% potential. My implementation is based on:

- Cognitive psychology research
- Visual perception studies  
- Reading comprehension optimization
- Eye-tracking and attention studies

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile development
- **JavaScript** - Primary development language
- **Firebase Backend** - Cloud database and authentication
- **Scientific Algorithm Implementation** - RSVP timing and presentation logic
